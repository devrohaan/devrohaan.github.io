## About

I have 10+ years of experience building scalable products across startups, enterprises, and freelance projects. I’ve led platform architecture, defined core engineering processes, and scaled teams to drive long-term product growth. My work spans full product lifecycles — from system architecture to development, deployment, and performance optimization — with a focus on high-performance, scalable systems.

Alongside professional work, I maintain open-source learning repositories focused on Full Stack Development, Python automation, Machine Learning, NLP, and Distributed Systems.
